# PyQt6

It is a free library in python for creating **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** based on Qt in C++.
*****
I start from implementing elementary widgets:
QLabel : for showing label text
QPushButton: simple button
QLineEdit: user can write on it
QSpinBox: increase/decrease or re-asign value
QTable: creating table
QGridLayout: enable adding widget gridly
QInputDialog: getting text, num or item from user

I gather together them in [this folder](pyqt_widgets).

*****

Then I try to create simple node pad as a self defined project. you can see code in
[this filder](notePad_Project).

for running go to directory contain both codes i.e:
 [Design]("notePad_Project/note_pad_design.py") and [functionalities]("notePad_Project/note_pad.py")
manually or by:
```
cd notePad_Project
```

and then run note_pad.py :

```
python note_pad.py
```
